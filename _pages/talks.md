Generating lane-level road networks from high-precision trajectory data
------
We develop a lane-level road network generation method using high-precision trajectory data. The method adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy for complex road network extraction, and effectively addresses the challenge posed by lane structure changes and interference of lane-changing behavior. 

This industry-driven research project, conducted in collaboration with Changan Automobile Company, has been successfully integrated into Changan Automobile's crowdsourced mapping application.

Exploring the relationship between human activities and COVID-19 morbidity using location-based social media data
------
This study investigated COVID-19 morbidity and human activity patterns in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020. Based on Sina Weibo check-in data, we characterized human activity factors and revealed how the human relevant factors influenced COVID-19 transmission in Wuhan City during the early pandemic stage.
