I am currently an MPhil student in the Department of Geography Information Engineering at Wuhan University, supervised by [Prof. Peng Yue](http://geos.whu.edu.cn/peng.html). My current work is concentrated on map construction and lane-level road network generation from large collections of trajectories. I am also passionate about mining human activity patterns from geospatial data, such as location-based social media data. 

My research interest includes but is not limited to

- Geospatial data mining
- Transportation geography
- Public health
- Human activity

Previous Research Explorations
------
**Location-Based Social Media Data Analysis**

My previous research focus on extraction, analysis and visualization of human acticity patterns from location-based social media data, Sina Weibo Check-in data.
Here are the two study cases.

**Exploring the Relation between Human activities and COVID-19 Morbidity using Location-Based Social Media Data**

This study investgates COVID-19 morbidity and transmission from December 2019 to January 2020 in Wuhan. Using Sina Weibo check-in data, we characterize Wuhan citizens’ activity patterns and the relationship between human mobility and the spread of COVID-19 in the early pandemic stage. This study reveals the relevant factors influencing COVID-19 transmission within the city and the mechanisms of transmission impact.

**When, where and why do social media users makeup? Interpretation from Sina Weibo check-ins and selfies.**

In this study, I developed a deep learning-based model for detecting facial retouching in selfie images on the social media platform, Sina Weibo. This work trying to understand and explain social media users' makeup behavior from the perspective of geography and sociology, including its spatial and temporal patterns and possible motivations.
