I am currently an MPhil student in the Department of Geography Information Engineering at Wuhan University, supervised by [Prof. Peng Yue](http://geos.whu.edu.cn/peng.html). My current work is concentrated on map construction and lane-level road network generation from large collections of trajectories. I am also passionate about mining human activity patterns from geospatial data, such as location-based social media data. My research interest includes but is not limited to

- Geospatial data mining
- Transportation geography
- Public health
- Human activity
