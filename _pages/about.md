I am currently an MPhil student in the Department of Geography Information Engineering, School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, at Wuhan University, supervised by [Prof. Peng Yue](http://geos.whu.edu.cn/peng.html). My research interest includes but is not limited to

- Geospatial data mining
- Transportation geography
- Public health
- Human activity

My current work is concentrated on map construction and lane-level road network generation from large collections of trajectories. I am also passionate about mining and analyzing human activity patterns from geospatial data, such as location-based social media data.

Previous Research Explorations
------
**Location-Based Social Media Data Analysis**

My previous research focus on extraction, analysis and visualization of human acticity patterns from location-based social media data. Here are the two study cases.

* **Exploring the Relationship between Human activities and COVID-19 Morbidity using Location-Based Social Media Data**

  This study investgates COVID-19 morbidity and transmission in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020. Based on Sina Weibo check-in data, we characterize human activity patterns and reveal how the human relevant factors influencing COVID-19 transmission in the early pandemic stage.

* **When, where and why social media users makeup? Interpretation from Sina Weibo check-ins and selfies.**

  In this study, I developed a deep learning-based model for detecting facial retouching in selfie images on the social media platform, Sina Weibo. This study is trying to understand and explain social media users' makeup behavior from the perspective of geography and sociology, including its spatial-temporal patterns and possible motivations.
