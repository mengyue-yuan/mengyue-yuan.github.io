I am currently an MPhil student in the Department of Geography Information Engineering at Wuhan University, supervised by [Prof.Peng Yue](http://geos.whu.edu.cn/peng.html). My current work is concentrated on extraction, analysis and visualization of mobility patterns from large collections of trajectories.

My research interest includes but is not limited to

- Geospatial data mining
- Transportation geography
- Human mobility
- Public health
